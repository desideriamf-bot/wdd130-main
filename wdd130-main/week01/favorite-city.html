    <h1>My favorite city</h1>
    <p>My favorite place is the temple in the Dominican Republic. </p>
    <p>At the beginning, this palce felt normal to me becouse i had 
        easy access and could go there any time. However, now that 
        I am far away, I miss this place so much.

        Today, I can truly say that it is my favorite place. since
        i left my country, i have never felt the same way about any 
        other place, I love it.</p>
