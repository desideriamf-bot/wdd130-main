        <p>Hi, My name is Desideriam from Dominican Republic and I am starting in web programming at
            BYU-Idaho online. It is the best I have tried before. I feel
            I allready found my passion and I will give all of me to it.

        <p>The Dominican Republic is a beautiful island where people are very happy and usually in a good mood. We love
            music and
            dancing, and we are different from the rest of the world. Because we try to make life easier and happier. It
            is a place where people eat traditional food, and everything is a
            reason to smile. Problems can become a way to be creative, and even in the middle of them, we dance a
            little, laugh at
            ourselves, and keep moving forward.</p>
